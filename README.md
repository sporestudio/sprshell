# SPRSHELL
A simply shell made in pure C.

## Basic lifetime of a shell
Let's look at a shell from the top down. A shell does three main things in its lifetime.

- **Iniatialize:** In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These changes aspects of the shell's behavior.
- **Interpret:** Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
- **Terminate:** After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, free ups any memory, and terminates.

## Basic loop of a shell
So weâ€™ve taken care of how the program should start up. Now, for the basic program logic: what does the shell do during its loop? Well, a simple way to handle commands is with three steps:

- **Read:** Read the command from standard input.
- **Parse:** Separate the command string into a program and arguments.
- **Execute:** Run the parsed command.
